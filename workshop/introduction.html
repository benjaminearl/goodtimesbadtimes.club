      → Introduction<br><br>
      Radio is on the rise again. Especially since COVID-19 hit and alternative ways of
      interacting and communicating were needed, new online radio initiatives seem to be
      popping up everywhere. Some may say it’s just another quarantine hype, nevertheless the
      medium has great potential as an educational tool.<br><br>
      For the past years there have been radio stations and collectives broadcasting from various
      art schools and institutions around The Netherlands, such as Ja Ja Ja Nee Nee Nee, Radio
      Rietveld, Sandberg’s PUB, WT’s Phantom Radio and KABK’s Mushroom Radio – to name
      just a few. The internet radio ‘scene’ is very non-competitive community-oriented, where
      stations are happy to share knowledge and plug each other. There is even talk about using
      radio in unionising students from art schools nation-wide. It’s a medium that seems to
      empower and bring people together.<br><br>
      Besides a platform for sonic experimentation or showcasing anything audio-based, radio
      provides a concentrated space for discussion and reflection, due to its purely auditory
      nature. Focusing on language through one sense only, thoughts unfold linearly on both
      the producing and receiving end of the process. This contributes to the appeal of radio as
      opposed to other types of media where we are bombarded with visual prompts that distract
      from the message.<br><br>
      Still the visual side of online radio should not be overlooked. Before you’ve got your
      audience tuning in, they need to know where and when to hit that play button. In this
      workshop we’ll run through all stages of developing a radio station, from learning
      about hardware and software, creating a web server and website to host your station to
      experimenting with the interplay of audio content and its visual vessel. <br><br>
